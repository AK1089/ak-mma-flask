# AK1089's Minr Map Art Generator
This repository is the source code for the [web version](https://ak-mma-flask.herokuapp.com) of this tool.
This program is designed to make the process of making custom art for Minr projects easier. Upload any PNG, and a script is automatically generated, uploaded and sent to #staff_requests on the Minr Discord to be imported easily.
The website is hosted using Heroku, and runs on the Flask web framework for Python.
If you notice any bugs with the website, or have any feedback or questions, feel free to DM me on Discord or start a pull request here.
